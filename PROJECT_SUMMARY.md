## 💡 Key Insights About Your Product

Based on building this, here's what I understood:

**The Core Problem:**
Indian PR operates in a fragmented ecosystem where proving ROI is nearly impossible with traditional metrics (AVE). Professionals are burning out on manual work across multiple languages and regions.

**Your Solution:**
Transform PR from subjective art to data-driven science by:
1. Automating multilingual adaptation (efficiency)
2. Tracking actual conversions (ROI proof)
3. Timing pitches with AI (relationship enhancement)
4. Predicting crises early (risk mitigation)

**The Moat:**
Your competitive advantage is the **proprietary data layer** - regional media monitoring, journalist profiling, and conversion attribution that creates a flywheel effect.

**Business Model Potential:**
- SaaS subscription (tiered by agency size)
- Per-placement pricing (conversion tracking)
- Enterprise licenses (crisis monitoring)
- API access for custom integrations
